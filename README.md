Decoding Motorola format MM1 and MM2 with an Arduino (errors solved for locdecoder in de version of laserlight)

The sniffer program displays all MM1 - MM2 code that is on a track ..

The LocoFuntion yields the code for a loc decoder and has been fully tested in MM1 and MM2 modus.
This programs gives you the possibility
